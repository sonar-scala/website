import vars from "../../vars";

For an out-of-the-box setup, you can use the following docker-compose recipe or
a docker image with SonarQube which contains bundled sonar-scala plugin. Please
see [mwz/sonar-scala-docker](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala-docker) for more
details or simply follow this guide.

Alternatively, if you already have a SonarQube instance or you don't want to use
Docker, you can download the latest
[release](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases) jar into your SonarQube
plugins folder `/opt/sonarqube/extensions/plugins` and restart SonarQube either
manually or using the update center.

For automating the analysis of your Scala projects, check out
[mwz/sbt-sonar](https://github.com/mwz/sbt-sonar) sbt plugin and the
documentation [here](sbt-sonar.mdx). Alternatively, see the
[examples](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/tree/master/examples) directory in
sonar-scala repository, which includes example projects for SBT _(`1.x`)_,
Gradle _(`5.x`)_ and Maven _(`3.x`)_ along with basic instructions on how to
execute SonarQube analysis for each of those projects without sbt-sonar.

## Quick start

Let's start off by adding the following sbt plugins to your Scala project, in
the `./project/plugins.sbt` file:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("org.scoverage" % "sbt-scoverage" % "1.6.1")
addSbtPlugin("com.github.mwz" % "sbt-sonar" % "${vars.sbtSonarVersion}")
```

We've added the [sbt-scoverage](https://github.com/scoverage/sbt-scoverage)
plugin so that we can generate a coverage report and the
[sbt-sonar](sbt-sonar.mdx) plugin to easily trigger an analysis via an sbt task.

Let's start a local SonarQube server for demonstration purposes.

```bash
docker run -p 80:9000 \
  mwizner/sonarqube-scala-plugins:latest-full
```

Once SonarQube starts up, you should see the message saying that
`SonarQube is up` and the UI should be available through http://localhost. The
login credentials are `admin:admin` in case you want to browse around.

<div className="alert alert--warning" role="alert">
  Since we haven't specified an external database for SonarQube to use, it runs
  in a demo mode using an embedded database, which will be lost once the docker
  container is stopped. Please use an external database in a production
  environment.
</div>

Finally, let's execute a SonarQube scan via sbt.

```bash
sbt -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost \
  clean coverage test coverageReport sonarScan
```

Once the scan completes successfully, you can navigate to
http://localhost/projects to see the results.

This basic setup should report to SonarQube all of the useful Size, Coverage and
Test metrics (listed [here](about/supported-metrics.mdx)) in addition to raising
any Scalastyle issues that were identified in your project.

<div className="alert alert--warning" role="alert">
  Running analysis from a Windows machine is currently not supported - please
  use Linux or other Unix-like operating system.
</div>

## Scapegoat

Let's add [Scapegoat](https://github.com/sksamuel/scapegoat) to our project to
get even more useful report.

Add following sbt plugin to your Scala project, in the `./project/plugins.sbt`
file:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("com.sksamuel.scapegoat" % "sbt-scapegoat" % "1.1.0")
```

Set the latest Scapegoat version and the format of a report generated by
Scapegoat in your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
scapegoatVersion in ThisBuild := "1.3.9"
scapegoatReports := Seq("xml")
```

Also, to make sure your project doesn't fail to compile due to any Scapegoat
errors, you can temporarily override the default severity level of all the
inspections - all Scapegoat issues will be still reported to SonarQube with the
correct severity level according to the configuration in your quality profile.

```scala
scalacOptions in Scapegoat += "-P:scapegoat:overrideLevels:all=Warning"
```

You can now run the `scapegoat` task using sbt, which should generate a report
with all the style issues that Scapegoat identified.

```bash
sbt scapegoat
```

Once you've done that, you will need to run the `sonarScan` task again to
include the Scapegoat report in SonarQube analysis.

Here are all of the sbt tasks put together:

```bash
sbt -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost \
  clean coverage test coverageReport scapegoat sonarScan
```
