## [7.9.0 LTS](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v7.9.0) - 11.01.2020

Updated Scalastyle to
[v1.1.0](https://github.com/beautiful-scala/scalastyle/releases/tag/v1.1.0),
which brings the following changes:

New Scalastyle rules ([#342](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/pull/342) -
[@mwz](https://github.com/mwz)):

- New `ForLoopChecker` rule - omit braces if you have a `yield` clause,
  otherwise, surround the contents with curly-braces, even if the contents are
  only a single line.
- New `WhileBraceChecker` rule - it's recommended to never omit braces when
  using `while`.
- New `CaseBraceChecker` rule - braces aren't required in `case` clauses.

Scalastyle rule changes:

- `HeaderMatchesChecker` has a new parameter `regex` to indicate whether to
  treat the header string as a regular expression; defaults to `false`.
- `MethodLengthChecker` has a new parameter `ignoreEmpty` to exclude empty lines
  from being counted; defaults to `false`.
- `ForBraceChecker` has a new parameter `singleLineAllowed` to indicate whether
  a one-line `for` expressions with parentheses are allowed; defaults to
  `false`.
- `NonASCIICharacterChecker` has a new parameter `allowStringLiterals` to
  indicate whether non-ASCII scripts in string literals should be allowed;
  defaults to `false`.

All of the above rules are activated with the default parameter values in the
`Scalastyle`, `Scalastyle+Scapegoat` and the `Recommended by sonar-scala`
quality profiles.

## [7.8.0 LTS](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v7.8.0) - 23.12.2019

- Implemented a new mode for pull request decoration. In this mode, sonar-scala
  will review pull requests on Github and make comments on new issues directly
  in the pull request instead of reporting them to SonarQube.  
  To read more about this feature, see the documentation
  [here](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala#pull-request-decoration-new).

  to disable the Scoverage sensor (defaults to `false`).
  ([#169](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/169) -
  [@BalmungSan](https://github.com/BalmungSan))

## [6.8.0 LTS](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.8.0) - 03.03.2019

- Backported features and bug fixes from the 7.x series - new unit test metrics
  such as unit test count, duration of each test and the number of skipped and
  failed tests - see the release notes from
  [7.3.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v7.3.0) and
  [7.3.1](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v7.3.1) releases for
  more details. ([#164](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/164) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))

## [7.3.1](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v7.3.1) - 27.01.2019

- Fixed Scalastyle rule lookup for custom rules created from templates.
  ([#148](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/148) -
  [@satabin](https://github.com/satabin))

## [7.3.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v7.3.0) - 30.12.2018

- Implemented a new sensor which saves unit test metrics such as unit test
  count, duration of each test and the number of skipped and failed tests. To
  use the new sensor, set the `sonar.tests` property which should point to
  directories containing tests (usually `src/test/scala`) and make sure you run
  your unit tests before you trigger sonar-scanner analysis. That's all you need
  to do in sbt unless you've changed the default location where sbt saves JUnit
  XML reports - then you'll also need to set the `sonar.junit.reportPaths`
  property (which defaults to `target/test-reports`). For projects using Gradle,
  setting both properties is necessary to make use of the sensor (Gradle outputs
  those in `build/test-results/test`), and Maven additionally requires the
  Surefire plugin to be installed. Please refer to the
  [sample](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/examples/) projects for example
  configuration for each build tool.
  ([#143](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/143) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))
- Fixed incorrect log messages about missing `sonar.scala.version` property.

  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))

## [6.7.0 LTS](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.7.0) - 09.12.2018

- Backported features from the 7.x series - new `Recommended by sonar-scala`
  quality profile and cleaned up Scapegoat rule repository, see the notes from
  [7.2.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v7.2.0) release for
  more details. ([#136](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/136) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))

## [7.2.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v7.2.0) - 03.12.2018

- Added a new quality profile `Recommended by sonar-scala`, which is a
  combination of Scalastyle and Scapegoat rules. We recommend using this profile
  as it excludes any duplicate rules and contains custom instances of Scalastyle
  templates set up in accordance with the current style guides recommended by
  the community. ([#130](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/130) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))
- Cleaned up Scapegoat rule repository and quality profiles by removing any
  Scapegoat rules which are no longer active in the upstream project.
  ([#132](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/132) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))

## [7.1.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v7.1.0) - 19.11.2018

- Added support for [SonarQube 7.4](https://www.sonarqube.org/sonarqube-7-4).
  ([#127](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/127) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))

## [7.0.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v7.0.0) - 08.10.2018

- Added support for [SonarQube 7.3](https://www.sonarqube.org/sonarqube-7-3).
  The current `6.x` series targeting _SonarQube 6.7 LTS_ will be still
  maintained and will follow the SonarQube LTS lifecycle.
  ([#120](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/120) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))
- Removed the following:

  - `sonar.scoverage.reportPath` property which was deprecated in
    [6.2.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.2.0) - please use
    `sonar.scala.scoverage.reportPath` instead;
  - the old Scalastyle quality profile and rule registry which were deprecated
    in [6.6.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.6.0);
    ([#120](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/120) -
    [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))

- Bumped up the default value of the `sonar.scala.version` property to `2.12`.
  ([#120](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/120) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))

## [6.6.0 LTS](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.6.0) - 30.09.2018

- Refactored Scalastyle module and introduced new Scalastyle rules repository
  along with a new quality profile, which now in addition to the latest
  Scalastyle rules also consists of rule templates which are activated by
  default. The existing Scalastyle quality profile and rule registry have been
  deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of the plugin (7.x).
  The new module also exposes the following optional property
  `sonar.scala.scalastyle.disable`, which allows you to disable the Scalastyle
  sensor. ([#35](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/35) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))
- New `Scalastyle+Scapegoat` quality profile, which includes all of the default
  rules from Scalastyle and Scapegoat quality profiles.
  ([#112](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/112) -
  [@BalmungSan](https://github.com/BalmungSan))
- Bumped Scapegoat up to `1.3.7`, which introduces a new inspection
  ([UnsafeStringContains](https://github.com/sksamuel/scapegoat/blob/v1.3.7/src/main/scala/com/sksamuel/scapegoat/inspections/string/UnsafeStringContains.scala))
  and other various fixes and improvements - see the
  [diff](https://github.com/sksamuel/scapegoat/compare/v1.3.5...v1.3.7) for more
  details. ([#100](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/100) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))
- Scapegoat sensor now also works with absolute file paths in the Scapegoat
  report. ([#116](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/116) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))

## [6.5.1 LTS](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.5.1) - 11.08.2018

- This release fixes an issue with Scapegoat sensor using a single report for
  each module in multi-module projects.
  ([#96](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/96) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))

## [6.5.0 LTS](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.5.0) - 09.07.2018

- Introduced support for [Scapegoat](https://github.com/sksamuel/scapegoat)
  linter. This version of the plugin ships with a **Scapegoat** rule repository,
  quality profile as well as a new sensor, which reads the xml report generated
  by Scapegoat and submits Scapegoat issues to SonarQube. To use this feature,
  you need to set up Scapegoat in your project and make sure you generate a
  Scapegoat report before running `sonar-scanner`, see
  [sbt-scapegoat](https://github.com/sksamuel/sbt-scapegoat) for SBT
  integration. This feature exposes the following optional properties:

  - `sonar.scala.scapegoat.reportPath` - relative path to the scapegoat report
    (defaults to
    `target/scala-${sonar.scala.version}/scapegoat-report/scapegoat.xml`) and
  - `sonar.scala.scapegoat.disable` - which allows you to disable the Scapegoat
    sensor from being executed on your sources (defaults to `false`)

  A massive thanks to [@BalmungSan](https://github.com/BalmungSan) for
  implementing this feature!

## [6.4.0 LTS](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.4.0) - 23.05.2018

- Improved logging in the Scoverage sensor.
  ([#61](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/61) -
  [@BalmungSan](https://github.com/BalmungSan))
- Fixed Scoverage issues with multi-module Gradle projects. Please see the
  [examples](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/tree/master/examples) for a
  reference on how to configure Gradle projects and how to execute SonarQube
  analysis. ([#63](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/63) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))

## [6.3.0 LTS](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.3.0) - 12.05.2018

- Use semantic versioning scheme to parse the `sonar.scala.version` property.
  The patch version is now ignored and `2.11` and `2.12` are valid version
  numbers. In case of a missing value or an incorrect version the property
  defaults to `2.11.0`. ([#53](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/53) -
  [@BalmungSan](https://github.com/BalmungSan))
- Fixed an issue which affected Gradle users and caused the sonar sources prefix
  `sonar.sources` to be appended twice to filenames in the Scoverage report.
  ([#56](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/56) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))

## [6.2.0 LTS](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.2.0) - 28.04.2018

- Added support for multiple source locations configured by the `sonar.sources`
  property. As per SonarQube
  [documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analysis+Parameters),
  the paths should be separated by a comma. Additionally, the paths can now be
  absolute, which allows sonar-scala to work with
  [SonarQube Maven plugin](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner+for+Maven).
  ([#52](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/52) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))
- The Scoverage report path property `sonar.scoverage.reportPath` was deprecated
  and will be removed in the next major version. Please use
  `sonar.scala.scoverage.reportPath` instead.
  ([#46](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/46) -
  [@BalmungSan](https://github.com/BalmungSan))

## [6.1.0 LTS](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.1.0) - 28.03.2018

- The Scoverage sensor was rewritten from scratch; introduced a new branch
  coverage metric. ([#34](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/34) -
  [@BalmungSan](https://github.com/BalmungSan))
- Addressed coverage measure warnings reported by sonar-scanner during analysis.
  ([#18](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/18) -
  [@BalmungSan](https://github.com/BalmungSan))
- Added a new property `sonar.scala.version` to specify Scala version.
  ([#2](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/2) -
  [@ElfoLiNk](https://github.com/ElfoLiNk))

## [6.0.0 LTS](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.0.0) - 10.02.2018

- Support for SonarQube 6.7.1 LTS.
  ([#5](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/issues/5) -
  [@mwz](https://github.com/mwz))
