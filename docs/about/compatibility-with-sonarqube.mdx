title: Compatibility with SonarQube
---

We do our best to provide sonar-scala for both the latest SonarQube release
series and the current LTS version. We currently support
[SonarQube 7.9 LTS](https://www.sonarqube.org/sonarqube-7-9-lts) and the 8.x
series. Releases for
[SonarQube 6.7 LTS](https://www.sonarqube.org/sonarqube-6-7-lts) can be also
found in the table below, but this version of SonarQube is no longer actively
maintained and we recommend upgrading to 7.9 LTS.

We also support Scala 2.11 and 2.12, support for Scala 2.13 is coming soon.
