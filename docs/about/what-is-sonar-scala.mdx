title: What is sonar-scala?
---

Sonar-scala is a free, open-source and independent
[SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org) plugin for static code analysis of Scala
projects. It's driven and developed by the
[community](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/graphs/contributors).

Sonar-scala is developed in Scala. It uses the
[scalariform](https://github.com/scala-ide/scalariform) library to parse the
source code and integrates with [Scoverage](http://scoverage.org) (code
coverage), [Scalastyle](http://www.scalastyle.org) and
[Scapegoat](https://github.com/sksamuel/scapegoat) (static code analysis). It
also provides [pull request decoration](../setup/pr-decoration.mdx)
functionality, which can review pull requests on Github and make comments on new
issues directly in the pull request instead of reporting them to SonarQube.

The major advantage of sonar-scala over the official
[SonarScala](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/codeanalyzers/sonarscala.html)
plugin is that it's built around tools such as Scalastyle and Scapegoat at it's
core. It provides built-in rules and quality profiles for both of those tools,
which allows you to easily explore those rules and get an aggregated view of
existing issues across all of your projects. Scalastyle is built right into the
plugin and doesn't require any additional set-up on your end. Additionally,
sonar-scala supports pull request decoration on GitHub, for which SonarScala
requires either a paid Developer Edition of SonarQube or SonarCloud
subscription. Sonar-scala is free and will always remain free!
