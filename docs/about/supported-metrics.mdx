title: Supported Metrics
---

In addition to reporting Scalastyle and Scapegoat issues, sonar-scala currently
supports the following SonarQube
[metrics](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Metric+Definitions):

**Size**

- Number of classes (and objects) - `classes`
- Number of lines containing either comments or commented-out code -
  `comment_lines`
- Number of files (computed by the platform) - `files`
- Lines of code - `ncloc`
- Number of functions - `functions`

**Coverage**

- Number of lines of code which could be covered by unit tests -
  `lines_to_cover`
- Number of lines of code which are not covered by unit tests -
  `uncovered_lines`
- Percentage of line coverage - `line_coverage`

In addition to the above, sonar-scala reports the following custom metrics,
which are extracted from a Scoverage report:

- Number of all statements - `sonar-scala-scoverage-total-statements`
- Number of statements covered by tests -
  `sonar-scala-scoverage-covered-statements`
- Percentage of statement coverage - `sonar-scala-scoverage-statement-coverage`
- Number of all branches - `sonar-scala-scoverage-total-branches`
- Number of branches covered by tests - `sonar-scala-scoverage-covered-branches`
- Percentage of branch coverage - `sonar-scala-scoverage-branch-coverage`

**Tests**

- Number of unit tests - `tests`
- Number of skipped unit tests - `skipped_tests`
- Number of unit test errors - `test_errors`
- Number of unit test failures - `test_failures`
- Execution duration of unit tests - `test_execution_time`
